# Script to set Oracle environment using database names from crsctl,
# get SID from ps -ef | grep pmon (excluding asm*, apx*, mgmtdb),
# connect to each PDB, and get the used size of all PDBs in a single-node RAC database.
# Assumptions:
# - Run as the oracle user with access to crsctl, sqlplus, and oraenv.
# - Grid Infrastructure is installed, and crsctl is in PATH.
# - oraenv is available to set the Oracle environment.
# - Databases and instances are running; offline databases/PDBs are skipped.
# - Uses OS authentication (/ as sysdba) for SQL*Plus connections.
# - Assumes Container Databases (CDBs) contain PDBs.
# - Single-node RAC, so SID can be obtained from pmon process.
